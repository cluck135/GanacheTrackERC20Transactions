# GanacheTrackERC20Transactions

## Description 
Deployed an ERC20 Contract(0xB975834d9B6e0C54c558cA82f6f3058dA360d5d4) FDT token. Then use that contract address to mint my own tokens on the Ganache local test blockchain. By adding my own plugin with the ABI code from the contract from remix we can then add it too our moralis server so that we can see any transactions of the token.
